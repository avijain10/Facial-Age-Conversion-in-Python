This is the link to the age conversion blog which I read to understand the working of face app.

Style based age manipulation technique:

This is the link to the Git Repo where a demo code for face transformation is given:

This is a google collab notebook code.



Ways to convert the google collab code into python script:

a) By using anvil, we can create a web app and connect it to the google collab, we have to do certain programming according to the frontend of the web app. In this way, we can work with the google collab and develop a web app as well. To see more details about anvil and the programming structure link the click below:

b)We have one more option of converting the google collab notebook to python code and then scheduling through apache airflow, but it seems quite complicated. Apache airflow https://airflow.apache.org is a free to use software.
